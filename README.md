# Cosmetic Product Discontinuation Risk Analysis

##  Project Overview
This academic capstone project analyzes cosmetic product data from the **California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP)** to identify patterns and risk factors associated with **product discontinuation**. The goal is to support regulatory compliance, product strategy, and consumer safety using data-driven insights.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze large-scale cosmetic product and chemical composition data
- Predict the likelihood of product discontinuation using machine learning
- Identify high-risk chemicals and product attributes influencing discontinuation
- Provide interpretable insights for regulatory and business decision-making

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Model Explainability**: Feature importance analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Source**: California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP)
